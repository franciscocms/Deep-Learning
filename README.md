# Deep-Learning

This repository is used to show the implementation of some Deep Learning architectures.

These models were implemented as part of personal projects related to Deep Learning tasks (classification, segmentation, etc).

By far, includes:
* A static version of U-Net, from the first time I implemented to an image segmentation task;
* A dynamic U-Net with possibility of using a ResNet encoder (with some modifications to better integrate these two models); 
* ResNet dynamic code for versions 18-34-50-101-152
